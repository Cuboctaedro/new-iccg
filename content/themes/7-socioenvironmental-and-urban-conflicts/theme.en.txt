Subject: s7

Text: 

Within the persistent, contemporary, structural capitalist crisis there is a global bourgeois project of re-making nature which basically serves the four pillars of globalization, deregulation, technocratic policy and interests of large enterprises. From China to the US and from Africa to the EU, there are hundreds of current examples of the commodification, marketisation and financialisation of nature. On the other hand, we face an upsurge of socio-environmental grassroots movements waging resistance in very heterogeneous environments both in rural and urban areas that seek to counteract the injustices and inequalities and reconfigure socio-ecological relations. 
All these conflicts and movements require a better and in-depth attention and critical reflection. What practical, political and theoretical innovations will allow us to better understand them, engage with them and contest them? What kinds of (new) power relations are reproduced through the making of environmental markets, and what socio-spatial and environmental justice issues are brought to light? What can we learn from the ongoing socio-environmental movements? What are their claims for collective self-determination?
