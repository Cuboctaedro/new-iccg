Subject: s5

Text: 

These seem to be good days for authoritarian rule both in the global West and in the global South, nourished by a widespread sense of crisis and decline. Political freedoms deteriorate as opposition movements get under attack by various mutations of the war(s) on terror and state(s) of emergency. Authoritarian leaders gain massive support based on remaking or reframing external and internal enemies of the national bodies. The rise of neo-fascist movements and parties is reminiscent of what the ultimate perspective of nationalism and authoritarianism can be. Contributions to this sub-theme will discuss relevant theoretical and conceptual frameworks, as well as empirical research.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: authoritarian governments around the globe; law and order agendas and policies; geographies of the war on terror; neocolonial nationalism; far-right mobilizations; far-right violence; digital fascism; authoritarian visions within neo-liberal politics;  racial scapegoating.
