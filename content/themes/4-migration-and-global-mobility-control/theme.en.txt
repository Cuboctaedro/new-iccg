Text: 

Although human mobilities and different forms of migration are an ongoing phenomenon, they are today associated with emergency responses and confronted with restrictive migration policies. The “management of migration” from the global to the local is related to new forms of control and the multiplication of borders, producing (il)legalities and exclusions. Migration reshapes and is reshaped by contemporary spatialities, reflecting individual and collective practices that can be analyzed through the lens of autonomy within the migration process. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: governmentality of migration policies; securitization and border control practices; vulnerabilities; immobilities and waiting; gendered and feminist perspectives on migration; solidarity responses, coexistences, co-presences and conflicts in the urban space; identities, subjectivities and in the migration process.
