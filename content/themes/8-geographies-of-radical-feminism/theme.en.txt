Text: As neoliberal crises proliferate and mutate, feminist acquis come under attack the world over. Bills against legal abortion in Ireland and the US, protests against same-sex marriage in France, persecution of LGBTQI activists in Latin America, are only some of the many faces of the backlash against gender rights. At the same time, war and displacement produce gendered violence, womenâ€™s poverty deepens globally, and domestic and sexual violence rise. Differential access to safety, rights, mobility, education, housing, welfare, health, water and other basic goods is conditioned by the combined effects of economic exploitation, racism, nationalism, heterosexism, ageism and ableism. Under such circumstances, it is extremely important and timely to explore different paths to resistance as well as emerging feminist and queer imaginaries that anticipate other worlds. We would like to invite papers that explore more specifically the ways in which gender and sexuality become nodal points of domination and resistance, both in material and in knowledge terms. Possible topics of interest include but are not limited to: queer politics and nationalism; gender, sexuality and violence in conflict zones; war, human and non-human assemblages; gender, migration and citizenship; gender, precarity and crisis; feminist transnational politics; post-human imaginaries; feminist and queer epistemologies and epistemic injustice.
