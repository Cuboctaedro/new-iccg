Title: 6. New geographies of colonialism

----

Subject: s6

----

Text: In the increasingly harsher terrain of international (economic but not only) domination, the competition for the control of resources and the coercive imposition of biased regulations have been debated as new and/or continuing forms of colonialism and imperialism, affecting both people and places as well as potentialities for the future. In this sense, negotiations over international and humanitarian aid agreements, debt-associated arrangements, privatizations and economic pacts, wars and the externalization of migration further exacerbate uneven development and escalate colonial legacies. In this stream we welcome contributions that examine these issues (but not exclusively) through a post-colonial or neo-imperialism lens and contributions that discuss the potentialities of developing counter-narratives and institutions in these contexts.
