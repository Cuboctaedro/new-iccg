Text: Î‘usterity urbanism describes the multiple realities of cities in crisis in times of neoliberalism. Despite the diverse historical trajectories, many cities across the world seem to face similar transformations, connected to the retreat of the welfare state and the privatization of core public functions and services. Far from only representing an aggressive economic doctrine, austerity urbanism has multiple social, political and cultural implications; from the rise of new forms of deprivation and new geographies of polarization and inequality to the collapse of local economies and the subsequent crisis of social reproduction; and from changes in governance mechanisms and planning ideologies, to the rise of political contestation and the emergence of collective practices and novel solidarity initiatives. We welcome contributions that critically examine these issues and we aim to deepen our understanding on the repercussions of austerity urbanism in different cities and  discuss the possibilities for radical praxis.
