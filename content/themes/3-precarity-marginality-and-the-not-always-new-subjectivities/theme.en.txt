----

Subject: s3

Text: While cities are characterized by increasing social divisions, polarization and socioeconomic inequalities concerning access to decision making processes, labor and resources, urban contestations emerge around a multiplicity of issues: the challenge of major economic and political restructuring; the collapse of the welfare state; the claims of collective self-determination; the growing condition of precariousness for large parts of urban populations; the rise (and confrontation) of populist and right-wing movements; the everyday life negotiations and struggles over public goods and services. These contestations not only emerge in inter-related scales but also affect wider processes, discourses and practices in different spatial and social contexts. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  the role of urban and broader social movements, as well as actors beyond them (state and local authorities, NGOs, citizens’ organizations e.t.c.), in the production of new socio-spatial configurations, the inter and intra-national diffusion of social movements’ organizational characteristics and innovative attributes, the role of contestations in the production of new modes of urban governance and collective consumption, the emergence of new subjectivities and collective identities.
