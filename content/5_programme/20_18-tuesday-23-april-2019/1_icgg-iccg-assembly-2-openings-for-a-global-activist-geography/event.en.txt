    The ICGG/ICCG assemblies will reflect on
    our two decades of existence through
    testimonies by persons who have been
    part of this journey and through
    collective discussions and working
    groups that will consider where we stand
    today, whether we have succeeded in
    creating a different kind of scholar and
    political space, and what directions we
    shall take in light of our current
    political moment. Through these sessions
    we aim to gather and develop concrete
    ideas to be passed onto the next teams
    to guide our work and the future of the
    ICGG/ICCG. We look forward to have you
    on board for this thought-provoking,
    interactive and collective assemblies.
