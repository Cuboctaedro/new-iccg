    The 8th ICCG in Athens seeks to elaborate on the structural relations, materialities and cultures of uneven development and everywhere war, which bring about the condition of permanent crisis we find ourselves in the world over. Building on the previous ICCG 2015 conference, we regard “permanent crisis” as a regime that needs to be radically challenged in both political and theoretical terms, in our everyday lives as well as in the host of global, national and local institutions that reproduce it. We therefore want to invoke again the notion of praxis as the realisation of collective thinking and acting that is required in order to remake, to change the world.

    Since 2010, Greece has been in the maelstrom of a multi-faceted and far-reaching socio-economic and political crisis linked to EU/Eurozone reforms and to processes of global capitalist restructuring. In spite of talk about entering a post-crisis era, many aspects of the crisis and austerity regime are still unfolding and certainly the societal effects are entrenched and widespread. At the same time, Greece is geo-politically located in an area experiencing major power-shifts and population upheavals connected to the wars and global antagonisms in Syria and the Middle East. It has become one more, non-local, site of operations implicated in the perpetuation, but also resistance, of war violence.

    Greece has also witnessed intense and extensive social mobilisations and resistances, and attendant political changes. Massive demonstrations and strikes were followed by the emergence of novel solidarity initiatives addressing social reproduction issues. More recently, refugee solidarity and humanitarian interventions introduced a distinct inter- and transnational dimension to local mobilisations. But, right-wing populism and far right parties are also, as elsewhere in Europe, on the rise. Mobilisations have changed in terms of scale and content. Facing the question of permanent crisis the claim for radical praxis remains open.

    Taking Greece as an example, as a kind of “hot-spot” for observing key socio-spatial changes, the conference invites participants to explore different aspects of permanent crisis and the possibilities for radical praxis within local sites, as well as between local and broader determinants of socio-spatial change.
