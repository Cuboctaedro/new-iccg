Text: Akadimia Platonos is located at the west of the Municipality of Athens and is an mixed residential, industrial / warehousing area which includes a large urban park (Akadimia Platonos from which it draws its name) and a small part of agricultural land. The park of Akadimia Platonos constitutes an archaeological site where ancient philosopher Platon established the Akademia in 387 BC. Nowadays, Akadimia Platonos is considered a low-income neighborhood with a significant number of migrant population facing a number of urban challenges. The park is a vital public green space, attracting many people from the nearby areas but also from further away and host numerous local activities and other events. For more than a decade the neighboughood has been active, mostly against announced developments that would jeopardise the park; the history of these mobilizations and struggle is an inherent part of the neighbourhoods history and will form a part of this fieldtrip. These mobilizations and counter-actions may have provided the spark but since then an array of diverse initiatives and collectivities have emerged and shaped the local solidarity / collectivities terrain. Part of this fieldtrip will also discuss this with people involved in the local area, outlining the activities as well as the transformations and challenges that different collectivities have faced over the past decade.
