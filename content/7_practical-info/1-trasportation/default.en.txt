    **By bus:**
    Take bus X95 (just outside arrivals) to Syntagma (terminal). Buses run every 10 minutes during day and every 20 minutes the whole night. The ticket costs 6 euros.

    **By taxi:**
    Taxi from the airport to  the centre will cost you 35 euros during daytime and 50 euros after midnight (fix price).
